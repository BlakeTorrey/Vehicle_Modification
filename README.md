# Vehicle Modification

## Description

This project was created to demo how to create and manipulate objects using the console. It uses typescript and multiple classes to demonstrate 
the principles often seen in Object Oriented Programming.

Once the application is invoked using the command, the user can either select one of the pre-existing objects or create a new "vehicle" object. Then there are 
several options for manipulating the truck, like turning it on, accelerating, changing direction, and even unique ones depending on the type of vehicle.

## Installation

To install this project, first download the repository and navigate to it using a console. Then in the command line, type in "npm install & npm start". This 
will download all of the dependencies needed and start the program. From there the console should do the rest of the work and provide you with several options
until you are ready to exit the application.
